Scott Sikorski
Battleship game program. Allows for the user to guess where the ships are.
Grants a win if all the ships are hit. Grants a loss if the user runs out of moves.
Terminal based system where it shows the user where the ships are located if they choose to do so.
This can only be done 3 times the entire time. Shows a view without them that also gives where the user
has guessed already.
